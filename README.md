This project was bootstrapped from react-create-app. The original readme, including the instructions for development
and building, can be found in README.orig.md .

## Notes

* The structure used in this app roughly follows:
** https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1

* Some of the airbnb eslint rules have been changed:
** react/jsx-filename-extension
** env.browser set to true
** eslint-disable has been applied to registerServiceWorker (see notes at the top of the file)
